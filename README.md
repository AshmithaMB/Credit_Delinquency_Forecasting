### *Project Statement :*
*The aim of this project is to build a model that can classify customers into delinquent or non-delinquent based on their characteristics and delinquency status. The dataset contains information about customers, such as age, debt ratio, monthly income, and past payment behavior. The challenge is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify customers as delinquent or non-delinquent.*

#### *Project Overview :*
*The project involves several steps, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building. The dataset is analyzed using statistical techniques and visualizations to gain insights into the data. Missing values are handled using imputation techniques. Feature engineering is performed to create new meaningful features. The dataset is balanced using the SMOTE technique to address class imbalance. Various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, and ensemble methods, are employed to build the predictive model. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score are used to assess the model's performance.*

#### *Tools Used :* 
*The project utilizes Python programming language and several libraries for data analysis and machine learning. The libraries include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, imblearn, and catboost.*

### *Conclusion :* 
*The project aims to develop a model that can effectively classify customers into delinquent or non-delinquent based on their characteristics and past payment behavior. By using various machine learning algorithms and techniques such as feature engineering and balancing the dataset, the model can provide accurate predictions. The evaluation metrics help assess the model's performance, and the insights gained from the analysis can be used to make informed decisions regarding customer risk assessment and creditworthiness.*
